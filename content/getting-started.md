## Running OrientDB the First Time


- First, [Download](downloads.md) and extract OrientDB by selecting the appropriate package provided in our download page(click here for additional installation methods).
- Start the server by running the `server.sh` or `server.bat` scripts located in the bin folder.
- Once OrientDB is running, enter the following URL in a browser window: http://localhost:2480. This is Studio, the most advanced Web tool for Databases.


If youâ€™re new to OrientDB, we recommend taking a look at the following links:
